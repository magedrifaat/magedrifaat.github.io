I was accepted in tis year's Google Summer of Code program as a contibuter with [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index). The project I'm working on is "Improving TIFF Image support" and I'm being mentored by [carandraug](https://carandraug.net/).

The main objective of the project is to make use of the format specific library "libtiff" to handle Tiff images instead of the generic GraphicsMagick library that is currently used by Octave which only partially supports the tiff format specification and also has a compile-time fixed bit-depth (quantum) which isn't ideal in many use-cases.

You can find my project on the program site [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/EJ2ywyMC). I will be posting regular updates about the project and my progress here on this site.
