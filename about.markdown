My name is Maged Ahmed Rifaat. I am a Mechatronics Engineering student from Egypt and a software programming enthusiast. I like to work on personal projects as well as open source projects to deepen my knowledge and experience in the software engineering field and to help me pursue a career as a software developer.

I participated in the Google Summer of Code program in 2020 as a student with a successful project. You can find more about it [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5127791961440256).

I am also participating in this year's program as a contributer with GNU Octave. You can find out more about my project [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/EJ2ywyMC), and through the updates I post on this website.
